# --> This type of non-linear arrangement where a node is attached to one or more nodes directly beneath it, is a special type of graph known as tree. 
# --> In this data structure, the top most node is called the root and the connections between nodes are called edges. 
# --> Nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes and non-root and non-leaf nodes are called internal nodes.

# Example:-
# --> Family tree
# --> Company designation hierarchy
