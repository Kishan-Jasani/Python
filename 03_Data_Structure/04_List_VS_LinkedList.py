# --> We may choose between array or linked list for implementing list based on the problem statement. 
# --> If the problem has frequent insertions and deletions, prefer linked list. 
# --> Otherwise, if it involves only accessing the elements at random or in sequence with less number of insertions and deletions, use array.
