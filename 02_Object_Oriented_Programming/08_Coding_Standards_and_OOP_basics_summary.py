# --> Coding Standards in Python
'''
All variable names and method names should be in snake_case. 
All class names should be in PascalCase ( It is similar to camelCase but the first character is also Capitalized ). 

For example:

Classes:
Mobile
RegularCustomer

Methods:
change_password()
display_details()

Variables: 
price = 1000
brand = "Samsung"
'''


# --> OOP Basics - Summary
'''
1. OOP is a style of programming which allows us to club data and behavior together.

2. This is more suited for coding real life scenarios.

3. Objects are real world entities

4. Class is just a classification. It is just a concept.

5. Class is a description of attributes and behavior that objects of that classification should possess.

6. Attributes are created in a special function called __init__ and behaviors are created using functions called methods.

7. Objects can be created using ClassName() or using object literals for some of the built in classes

8. Attributes are created using reference_variable.attribute_name = value syntax.

9. Behavior is created by defining a function inside the class having a special parameter called self.
